A birthday tracker is a tool or system used to keep track of birthdays, often for friends,
family, or employees. It helps in remembering and planning for upcoming birthdays so you can 
send greetings, gifts, or organize celebrations. It can be as simple as a calendar or 
as complex as a software application that sends automated reminders and tracks past celebrations
